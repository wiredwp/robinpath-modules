# Diff

> Text and data diffing: line, word, character, object, and array diffs with unified output

**Package:** `@robinpath/diff` | **Category:** Utility | **Type:** Utility


## Authentication

No authentication required. All functions are available immediately.


## Use Cases

Use the `diff` module when you need to:

- **Diff two strings line by line** -- Use `diff.lines` to perform this operation
- **Diff two strings character by character** -- Use `diff.chars` to perform this operation
- **Diff two strings word by word** -- Use `diff.words` to perform this operation
- **Diff two objects** -- Use `diff.objects` to perform this operation
- **Diff two arrays** -- Use `diff.arrays` to perform this operation


## Quick Reference

| Function | Description | Returns |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| [`lines`](#lines) | Diff two strings line by line | `Array of {type, value}` |
| [`chars`](#chars) | Diff two strings character by character | `Array of {type, value}` |
| [`words`](#words) | Diff two strings word by word | `Array of {type, value}` |
| [`objects`](#objects) | Diff two objects | `Array of {path, type, oldValue?, newValue?}` |
| [`arrays`](#arrays) | Diff two arrays | `{added, removed, common}` |
| [`patch`](#patch) | Apply a line diff to produce the new string | `Patched string` |
| [`unified`](#unified) | Generate unified diff format (like git diff) | `Unified diff string` |
| [`isEqual`](#isequal) | Deep equality check | `True if deeply equal` |
| [`stats`](#stats) | Get diff statistics from a diff result | `{additions, deletions, unchanged}` |

diff.patch $lineDiff
```

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `diff` | `array` | Yes | Diff result from lines() |

---

### unified

Generate unified diff format (like git diff)

## Error Handling

All functions throw on failure. Common errors:

| Error | Cause |
|-------|-------|
| _(standard errors)_ | Check function parameters and authentication |

```robinpath
@desc "Lines and validate result"
do
  set $result as diff.lines $old $new
  if $result != null
    print "Success"
  else
    print "No result"
  end
enddo
```


## Recipes

### 1. Multi-step Diff workflow

Chain multiple diff operations together.

```robinpath
@desc "Lines, chars, and more"
do
  set $r_lines as diff.lines $old $new
  set $r_chars as diff.chars "cat" "car"
  set $r_words as diff.words $old $new
  print "All operations complete"
enddo
```

### 2. Safe lines with validation

Check results before proceeding.

```robinpath
@desc "Lines and validate result"
do
  set $result as diff.lines $old $new
  if $result != null
    print "Success: " + $result
  else
    print "Operation returned no data"
  end
enddo
```
